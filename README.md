# Whismur

Whismur is a python based sound wave analysis tool.  It aims to be able to classify unknown soundwaves as either music or speech using choosable ML techniques such as the kNN algorithm.  The idea is a user inputs a soundwave and specifies a technique after having trained the classifier.

I hope to extend this library to perform a variety of audio functions such as cleaning, trimming, silence removal, noise suppression, audio visualization, word recognition etc.
